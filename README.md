# PythonLetterCounter

This is a program solving a toy problem proposed to me by a teacher. It counts the occurences of each letter in a given string. 

Check out the [Java](https://github.com/Sebastian-Heinzenburger/JavaLetterCounter) and [C/C++](https://github.com/Sebastian-Heinzenburger/CppLetterCounter) implementations.
